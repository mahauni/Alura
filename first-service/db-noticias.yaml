      # ------------------------
      # not very good to do this, because of merging pod config with the image of the
      # pod, so is better to put everything in another file and make this file, more
      # "detached" i guess
      # SOLUTION IS TO USE ConfigMap

      # Possible to use like this
      # env:
      #   - name: "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD"
      #     value: "q1w2e3r4"
      #   - name: "MYSQL_DATABASE"
      #     value: "empresa"
      #   - name: "MYSQL_PASSWORD"
      #     value: "q1w2e3r4"

      # Possible to get 1 key per time with this kind of code 
      # env:
      #   - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
      #     valueFrom:
      #       configMapKeyRef:
      #         - name: db-configmap
      #           key: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD

      # Or pull the entire configMap
      envFrom:
        - configMapRef:
          name: db-configmap

# Need to add ENV_VARIABLES for the database to connect with the Pod
# is need like password, name, etc.
